	High: ipc_socket: Signalhandler must be resetted to Default, use only cleanup_sigpipe to return from qb_ipc_dgram_sock_setup.
	Some OS like Solaris/Illumos return with ECONNRESET or EPIPE in the case of a disconnecting peer.
	Change the return code to ENOTCONN and continue.

	Low: log: return filter type enum to preserve abi compatibilty with corosync
	This returns abi compatiblity with libqb v0.16.0. There was a subtle
	change in behavior caused by reordering the log filter enum in
	v0.17.0.

2014-06-05  Michael Chapman  <mike@very.puzzling.org>

	epoll: don't miss poll events under high load
	If multiple epoll sources generate events simultaneously, it is possible
	for more jobs to be added to particular priority level than will be
	handled in one go by qb_loop_run_level(). If one of these epoll sources
	gains a new event (say, by switching from "readable" to "readable and
	writeable"), then this new event would be missed.

	To fix this, merge new epoll events into revents regardless of whether
	the job is on the joblist. When the job is dispatched, revents will be
	cleared, or the epoll source will be deleted entirely.

	ipc_shm: fix error handling in qb_ipcs_shm_connect()
	The request and response SHM segments were being closed under the wrong
	labels, and the event SHM segment wasn't being cleaned up at all.

2014-06-04  Michael Chapman  <mike@very.puzzling.org>

	ringbuffer: fix size in qb_rb_create_from_file()
	qb_rb_open() expects the size field to represent the maximum chunk size.
	It adds QB_RB_CHUNK_MARGIN + 1 and rounds up to the page size to
	determine the ringbuffer's total size. When creating a ringbuffer from a
	file we must compensate by subtracting this amount from the file's size.

	ringbuffer: fix qb_rb_open_2() debug format string
	qb_log_target_formats() does not support formatting size_t values with
	%zd.  Use %ld to format them as long integers instead.
