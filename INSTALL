The Quarterback library Installation Guide

Please read COPYING for a description of the licensing of this software.

---------------------------------
* Platforms Built and Tested On *
---------------------------------
Quarterback has been tested on:
Linux: Fedora 12
OpenSolaris
BSD: FreeBSD
MacOSX: Darwin latest update

It should build and run properly on the tested platforms as well as possibly
others with minimal effort.  Quarterback requires a coherent mmap() system call
and will not operate on platforms which don't support coherent mmap().

----------------------------
* Building from git *
----------------------------
When building and installing from subversion, automake 2.61 or later is
required.  Prior versions will result in build failures.

Step 1: check out a copy of the repository
git clone git://git.fedoraprojects.org/git/quarterback

Find the version you want to build.  Usually this will be the "master"
branch.  If you want to build a specific released
version check 'git tag -l'.

Step 2: Generate the makefiles
balance: ./autogen.sh

Step 3: Run the configure script
Note that this will install to /usr by default to install to /usr/local use --prefix=/usr/local
balance: ./configure

Step 4: build
balance: make

Step 5: Install the binaries
balance: sudo make install

-------------------------
* Building from tarball *
-------------------------
The tarball is distributed with pregenerated makefiles.  There is no need
to run the autogen.sh script in this case.

Step 1: Run the configure script
balance:~/quarterback% ./configure

Step 2: Install the binaries
balance:~/quarterback% su
balance:~/quarterback# make install
