.TH QB-BLACKBOX 8 2017-07-27
.SH NAME
qb-blackbox \- Display "flight data" from the "blackbox".
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBqb-blackbox\fR [\fIblackbox-file\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqb-blackbox\fR prints out the logs (including debug logs) that were
recorded using libqb's blackbox mechanism.
.SS Portability notes
Due to variations amongst platforms, some of which directly impact
the libqb's blackbox format handling (e.g. page size), there's currently
only the commitment that \fBqb-blackbox\fR shall decode the blackbox files
recorded at the same plaform (plus the same page size) while using libqb
compiled with the same relevant compile-time options
(e.g. \fBUSE_CACHE_LINE_ALIGNMENT\fR) as linked to this decoder.
Otherwise, your mileage may vary.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Get info to help developers diagnose a crash.
