2012-02-07  The Quarterback Library Release Team  <quarterback-devel@fedorahosted.org>

	Bump the lib version to 0.10.0

2012-02-07  Angus Salkeld  <asalkeld@redhat.com>

	LOOP: handle errors from the poll function

	LOOP: make the item type applicable to jobs too.
	Mainly for diagnostics

	LOOP: fix the todo calculations.
	The todo system was sucky as it was calculated in different
	places in the mainloop and at each level. This was exposed by
	calls to qb_loop_level_item_del() which decremented the level->todo
	but not the mainloop one. So now we re-calculate it each time.

	TEST: check for a single job causing a cpu spin

	LOOP: prevent jobs from consuming too much cpu.

	Add a split timer to the stopwatch.
	This is just a re-work of Steve's sample patch.

	You set the number of splits and whether they overwrite using
	qb_util_stopwatch_split_ctl().
