	version: bump soname for 1.0.5 release

2019-04-23  Ferenc WÃ¡gner  <wferi@debian.org>

	Let remote_tempdir() assume a NUL-terminated name
	This is the case already.  We also fix a buffer overflow opportunity in
	the memcpy() call by this change.

	Make it impossible to truncate or overflow the connection description
	It's hard to predict the length of formatted output, so we'd better
	notice (and abort) if the description is truncated.  Incidentally,
	mkdtemp() does this for us in the shared memory branch, but do an
	explicit check there as well for consistency, and get rid of the wrongly
	parametrized strncat() risking a buffer overflow (CONNECTION_DESCRIPTION
	is not the length of the source "/qb").
	Similar truncation checks should be added to qb_ipcs_{shm,us}_connect()
	where they build the request/response names, and possibly to other
	places using snprintf().

	Allow group access to the IPC directory
	And don't abort if we aren't permitted to chown() it.  The client might
	still have the privileges to enter it.

	Errors are represented as negative values

	Fix garbled Doxygen markup
	Part of d0ec0a6 on the master branch: fix the unreadable docstring.

	Fix spelling: plaform -> platform
