# (for my own sanity).
#
# 1) If you have changed any of the sources for this library, the revision
#    number must be incremented. This is a new revision of the current
#    interface.
#
# 2) If the interface has changed, then current must be incremented, and
#    revision reset to `0'. This is the first revision of a new interface.
#
# 3) If the new interface is a superset of the previous interface
#    (that is, if the previous interface has not been broken by the changes
#    in this new release), then age must be incremented. This release is
#    backwards compatible with the previous release.
#
# 4) If the new interface has removed elements with respect to the previous
#    interface, then you have broken backward compatibility and age must be
#    reset to `0'. This release has a new, but backwards incompatible
#    interface. For example, if the next release of the library included
#    some new commands for an existing socket protocol, you would use
#    -version-info 1:0:1. This is the first revision of a new interface.
#    This release is backwards compatible with the previous release.
#    Later, you implement a faster way of handling part of the algorithm
#    at the core of the library, and release it with -version-info 1:1:1.
#    This is a new revision of the current interface.
#    Unfortunately the speed of your new implementation can only be fully
#    exploited by changing the API to access the structures at a lower level,
#    which breaks compatibility with the previous interface, so you release
#    it as -version-info 2:0:0. This release has a new, but backwards
#    incompatible interface.
