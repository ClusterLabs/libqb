	log: journal: fix forgotten syslog reload when flipped from journal

2020-05-01  Ferenc Wágner  <wferi@debian.org>

	Let remote_tempdir() assume a NUL-terminated name
	This is the case already.  We also fix a buffer overflow opportunity in
	the memcpy() call by this change.
	Conflicts:
		lib/ipc_shm.c

	Make it impossible to truncate or overflow the connection description
	It's hard to predict the length of formatted output, so we'd better
	notice (and abort) if the description is truncated.  Incidentally,
	mkdtemp() does this for us in the shared memory branch, but do an
	explicit check there as well for consistency, and get rid of the wrongly
	parametrized strncat() risking a buffer overflow (CONNECTION_DESCRIPTION
	is not the length of the source "/qb").
	Similar truncation checks should be added to qb_ipcs_{shm,us}_connect()
	where they build the request/response names, and possibly to other
	places using snprintf().
