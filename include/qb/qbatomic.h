/**
 * @file
 * Basic atomic integer and pointer operations
 *
 * The following functions can be used to atomically access integers and
 * pointers. They are implemented as inline assembler function on most
 * platforms and use slower fall-backs otherwise. Using them can sometimes
 * save you from using a performance-expensive pthread_mutex to protect the
 * integer or pointer.
 *
 * The most important usage is reference counting. Using
 * qb_atomic_int_inc() and qb_atomic_int_dec_and_test() makes reference
 * counting a very fast operation.
 *
 * You must not directly read integers or pointers concurrently
 * accessed by multiple threads, but use the atomic accessor functions
 * instead. That is, always use qb_atomic_int_get() and qb_atomic_pointer_get()
 * for read outs. They provide the necessary synchonization mechanisms
 * like memory barriers to access memory locations concurrently.
 *
 * If you are using those functions for anything apart from
 * simple reference counting, you should really be aware of the implications
 * of doing that. There are literally thousands of ways to shoot yourself
 * in the foot. So if in doubt, use a pthread_mutex. If you don't know, what
 * memory barriers are, do not use anything but qb_atomic_int_inc() and
 * qb_atomic_int_dec_and_test().
 *
 * It is not safe to set an integer or pointer just by assigning
 * to it, when it is concurrently accessed by other threads with the following
 * functions. Use qb_atomic_int_compare_and_exchange() or
 * qb_atomic_pointer_compare_and_exchange() respectively.
