	Docs: refactor doxygen configuration files

2016-03-17  Jan Pokorný  <jpokorny@redhat.com>

	docs: *.dox.in: comment out the defaults/empty values
	This should also silent most of the warning when using older doxygen
	to compile the docs.

	docs: common.dox: use symbolic PROJECT_NAME

	docs: {html,man}.dox.in: extract common parts to common.dox

	docs: {html,man}.dox.in: unify where reasonable

	docs: {html,man}.dox.in: strip options for unused outputs

	docs: apply "doxygen -u" on {html,man}.dox.in, fix deprecations
	Previously, "make" in the top-level dir resulted in:
	> doxygen man.dox
	> warning: Tag `XML_SCHEMA' at line 1787 of file `man.dox' has become
	>          obsolete.
	>          To avoid this warning please remove this line from your
	>          configuration file or upgrade it using "doxygen -u"
	> warning: Tag `XML_DTD' at line 1793 of file `man.dox' has become
	>          obsolete.
	Reference doxygen version: doxygen-1.8.10-6.fc22.x86_64.
	This is to serve as a reference full-blown versions only to be
	subsequently compacted...

2016-03-14  Jan Pokorný  <jpokorny@redhat.com>

	CI: "make check" already included in "make distcheck"
	No need to waste time on redundant tests execution.

2016-03-11  Jan Pokorný  <jpokorny@redhat.com>

	build: tests: add intermediate check-headers target
	This is to allow running auto_header_check-based tests independently of
	the rest of the (possibly lengthy) tests.

	build: fix preposterous usage of $(AM_V_GEN)

2016-03-10  Jan Pokorný  <jpokorny@redhat.com>

	build: include: fix extra trailing newline

	build: tests: grab "public_headers" akin to docs precedent
	This required moving the test programs over from *_PROGRAMS and hooking
	the respective build recipe under explicit "check" target.

	build: docs: {dependent -> public}_headers + more robust obtaining

	build: extra clean-local rule instead of overriding clean-generic
	Previously, stuffing CLEANFILES with anything would not work in the
	affected files.

	build: drop extra qbconfig.h rule for auto_check_header self-test
	Although this is not as rigorously correct as the previous arrangement
	(introduced with 80834ea), i.e., from the perspective of
	$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/Makefile (generated from from
	$(top_srcdir)/tests/Makefile.am), for which $(top_builddir)
	is literally "..":
	- qbconfig.h is generated from $(top_srcdir)/include/qb/qbconfig.h.in
	  into $(top_builddir)/include/qb directory, and consumed from here
	- rest of these header files are consumed directly from
	  $(top_srcdir)/include/qb directory
	this new simplified variant:
	- avoids code duplication (DRY)
	- works thanks to VPATH in $(abs_top_builddir)/tests/Makefile
	  pointing to $(top_srcdir)/tests, which means that unsatisfied
	  dependencies on "$(top_builddir)/include/qb/%.h" (resolved to
	  "../include/qb/%.h") will be subsequently sought as
	  "$(top_srcdir)/tests/../include/qb/%.h", which has the same effect
	  as previous explicit "$(top_srcdir)/include/qb/%.h" specification
	  (note that such automatic VPATH provision is supported by automake
	   "since beginning" so no backward incompatibility is expected)

	build: fix out-of-tree build broken with 0b04ed5 (#184)
	Generating the man pages definitely doesn't depend on existence of
	(possibly generated) header files that we omit anyway.

	Build: prefer XZ tarball format

2016-03-09  Jan Pokorný  <jpokorny@redhat.com>

	CI: make sure RPM can be built all the time
	This is to prevent issues like the one being fixed with ebcff54
	(https://github.com/ClusterLabs/libqb/pull/197).
	Also, plain "make" invocation is dropped as it is an integral part
	of "make rpm" (%build phase in libqb.spec).

2016-03-08  Jan Pokorný  <jpokorny@redhat.com>

	build: switch to XZ tarball format for {,s}rpm packaging
	References:
	http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commit;h=8078d0b (~2009)
	http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commit;h=3d63df6 (ditto)

	build: do not try to second-guess "distdir" Automake variable
	Also make {,s}rpm targets generate only the tarball format that is
	consumed in the packaging process.

2016-03-08  Christine Caulfield  <ccaulfie@redhat.com>

	build: update library soname to 0.18.0
	as per guidelines here:
	http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html
	This shouldn't affect existing packages as the major version is still 0.

	...in the tarball arising from "make dist".
