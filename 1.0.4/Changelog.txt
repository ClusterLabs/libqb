	ipc: Use mkdtemp for more secure IPC files
	Use mkdtemp makes sure that IPC files are only visible to the
	owning (client) process and do not use predictable names outside
	of that.
	This is not meant to be the last word on the subject, it's mainly a
	simple way of making the current libqb more secure. Importantly, it's
	backwards compatible with an old server.
	It calls rmdir on the directory created by mkdtemp way too often, but
	it seems to be the only way to be sure that things get cleaned up on
	the various types of server/client exit. I'm sure we can come up with
	something tidier for master but I hope this, or something similar, will
	be OK for 1.0.x.
