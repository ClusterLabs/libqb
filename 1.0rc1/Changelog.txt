	Improvements to build process

	includes: Fix format string
	The format strings for QB_HDB_D_FORMAT & QB_HDB_X_FORMAT had no spaces
	between "%" and PRIx64. This is allowed, but technically incorrect and
	breaks C++11

	Fix: ipc: Prevent fd and memory leaks in handle_new_connection()
	In handle_new_connection(), connection_accept() could fail, which would
	leave the state of the connection inactive. Previously, in this case,
	the socket and the allocated qb_ipcs_connection would be leaked.

	log: don't call dlopen inside dl_iterate_phdr()
	Some platforms (eg. FreeBSD 10+) don't support calling dlopen() from
	within a dl_iterate_phdr() callback; so save all of the dlpi_names to
	a list and iterate over them afterwards.
	This fixes a deadlock which occurs in dlopen() when called from
	within dl_iterate_phdr() on FreeBSD 10+ when linked to libthr.
	Patch from dpejesh on github.

	tests: Allow more time for stress_connections tests
	On *BSD and other platforms the stress_connections can timeout and
	fail the tests. I've increased the timeout here to an hour as it
	takes nearly that long on my VM environment but it seems that's not
	common, luckily.
	This was also seen on mips/mipsel.

	ipc: Revert half of a previous *BSD ipc-name patch
	Only one of the strndup calls should have subtracted 9 from
	the name length. The other should have remained at 8.

	ipc: Don't send the dispatch_del() function a closed fd
	The current code closes the fd before passing it to the
	provided delete function. In the default case this can generate
	"epoll_ctl(del): Bad file descriptor" messages when debug logging
	is enabled.
	This patch swaps over the calls so that a valid FD is passed to
	the delete function.

	Fix deletion of sockets on *BSD platforms
	The code removed the last 8 characters of a socket name
	to get the 'base name', but 9 are needed.

	Update last reference to quarterback-devel mailing list

2015-09-09  Ken Gaillot  <kgaillot@redhat.com>

	docs: update doxygen files
	These are the results of "doxygen -u" to get rid of warnings.

	Add helper script for generating online documentation
	If build-aux/generate-docs is run from the top level of the checkout,
	it will prompt for the old and new version numbers, and generate
	doxygen, ABI compatibility and change log documentation,
	and commit them to the gh-pages branch.

	test: add helper script for running coverity

2015-08-28  Ken Gaillot  <kgaillot@redhat.com>

	update copy of gitlog-to-changelog to latest GNU version
	downloaded from http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob_plain;f=build-aux/gitlog-to-changelog

	minor fixes to check script's ABI report
	- update location of HTML output
	- don't exit if there were incompatible ABI changes
	- don't need branch name variable since we're not creating new branch for build anymore
