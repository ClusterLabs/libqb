		libqb coding style

Our coding style is basically https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst

And any differences will be appended here.

Chapter 5: Typedefs
- Use int32_t integer types and not "int" / "long".

Chapter 4: Naming
- functions preferably named object_verb

Chapter 8: Commenting
- Document public functions using doxygen style comments in the header file.
  We use doxygen to generate man pages.
